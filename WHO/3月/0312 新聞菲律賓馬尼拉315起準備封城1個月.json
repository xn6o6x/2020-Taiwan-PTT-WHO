Globally the virus has killed 4607 and infected 124519. COVID19 is a disease caused by a coronavirus called SARSCoV2 which is re lated to the virus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome but is not as deadly with the fatality rate standing at around three percent. According to the World Health Organization 80 percent of patients only expe rience “mild illness” and eventually recover. It added that some 14 percen t experience severe illness while five percent were critically ill. The disease is spread through small droplets from the nose or mouth when peo ple infected with the virus cough or sneeze. To prevent infection authorities are urging people to practice regular hand washing cover the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing and avoid clo se contact with those who show respiratory symptoms. Commonly reported COVID19 symptoms are fever dry cough and shortness of br eath. Those with severe and critical symptoms should call the Health Departm ent at (02) 86517800 local 11491150. The WHO has declared COVID19 a pandemic but stressed that this should not cause alarm as it can still be controlled since 90 percent of infections are being reported in only four countries while outbreaks in China and South K orea are slowing down. =============================== 簡單說，首都馬尼拉要封城1個月 據朋友說一堆人在超市搶屯糧食泡麵 https://i.imgur.com/uwCV49C.jpg BePTT", "date": "Thu Mar 12 22:02:41 2020", "ip":
